Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors" target="_blank">rules.</a>


A brief summary:

If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper.

I was tasked to create a simple version of this game with Python. One player is controlled by the computer and the other player is controlled by the user.

It makes use of inbuilt Python module <a href="ttps://www.w3schools.com/python/module_random.asp" target="_blank">random</a> and its <a href="https://pynative.com/python-random-choice/" target="_blank">choice method.</a>
